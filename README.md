# 🕵️‍♂️ Study Paradigm Summary 🕵️‍♀️

*"When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the paradigm."*
*(Adapted from Sherlock Holmes' "A Study in Scarlet")*

Welcome to **Study-Paradigm-Summary**! This repository is a detective-like investigation into different **programming paradigms** across various languages. Just as Sherlock Holmes solved mysteries, here we explore the unique characteristics of each language and how they approach problem-solving.

## 🔍 **What are Programming Paradigms?**

A **programming paradigm** is a *style* or *approach* to solving computational problems. It defines a program's structure and flow, influencing how programmers think and organize their code.

Some major paradigms include:
- **Imperative** (step-by-step instructions)
- **Object-Oriented** (organization through classes and objects)
- **Functional** (pure functions and immutability)
- **Logic** (declarative, rule-based)
- **Procedural** (subroutines and procedures)
- **Concurrent/Parallel** (simultaneous execution)

Now, let's examine the languages in this study!

---

## 🐍 **Python**
**Paradigms:** *Multi-paradigm (Object-Oriented, Imperative, Functional, Procedural)*
Python is versatile! It supports everything from simple scripts to complex systems with inheritance and polymorphism (OOP). It also enables functional programming with `map`, `filter`, and `lambdas`.

---

## ☕ **Java**
**Paradigms:** *Object-Oriented (strongly typed), Imperative*
Java is the methodical detective: everything is a class, and inheritance is essential. It has limited functional programming support (with `Streams` and `Lambdas` since Java 8).

---

## 🧠 **Prolog**
**Paradigms:** *Logic (Declarative)*
Prolog is the Sherlock Holmes of languages! You define **facts** and **rules**, and the language infers solutions through **unification** and **backtracking**.

---

## 🎻 **Racket**
**Paradigms:** *Functional (LISP-like), Multi-paradigm*
Racket is a Scheme dialect (LISP family) where functions are first-class citizens. It supports **macros**, **pure functional programming**, and even **OOP** with object systems.

---

## 📊 **Scilab**
**Paradigms:** *Procedural, Numerical (similar to MATLAB)*
Focused on scientific computing, Scilab works with matrices and mathematical functions procedurally, ideal for calculations and simulations.

---

## 🖥️ **C**
**Paradigms:** *Imperative, Procedural*
C is the classic detective: low-level, efficient, and function-structured. It has no native OOP but allows direct memory manipulation.

---

## 🏛️ **Fortran**
**Paradigms:** *Imperative, Procedural, Numerical*
The veteran Fortran pioneered scientific computing. It focuses on mathematical operations and arrays, still used in simulations and engineering.
